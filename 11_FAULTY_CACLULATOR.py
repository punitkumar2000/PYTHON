#FAULTY CALCULATOR
"""
Design a calculator which will correctly solve all the problems except the following ones:
45 * 3 = 555, 56+9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
Your program should take operator and the two numbers as input from the user and then return the result
"""

# print("Enter 1st Number:")
# num1 = int(input())
# print("Enter 2nd Number:")
# num2 = int(input())
# print("Enter your operator(+,-,*,/,%)")
# operator =input()
#
# if num1 ==45 and num2==3 and operator== '*':
#     print("555")
# elif num1 == 56 and num2 == 9 and operator == '+':
#         print("77")
# elif num1 == 56 and num2 == 6 and operator == '/':
#         print("4")
# elif operator== '*' :
#     multiplication= num1 * num2
#     print(multiplication)
# elif operator == '+':
#     addition= num2 + num1
#     print(addition)
# elif operator == '/':
#     division= num2 / num1
#     print(division)
# elif operator == '-':
#     subtraction= num2- num1
#     print(subtraction)
# elif operator == '%':
#     percent=num2%num1
#     print(percent)
# else:
#     print("Error! Please enter the correct input")
